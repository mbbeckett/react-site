# React Portfolio

## General Information 
This is my first project using a React library. Its a very simple portfolio but it allowed me to experiement with some of the basic building blocks of React. In this project, I explored different React packages such as React-Router-DOM and got the chance to experiment with libraries like Framer Motion. 

My project currently has a bare bones structure but I plan on implementing more features as I gain a deeper understanding of React. I look forward to using it in larger projects down the road.
